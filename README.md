This repository includes the code and data for the IEEE TPEL paper "***Parameter Estimation of Power Electronic Converters with Physics-informed Machine Learning***"

#### Abstract

Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has been emerging as a promising tool for applications with domain knowledge and physical models. To uncover its potentials in power electronics, this paper proposes a PIML-based parameter estimation method demonstrated by a case study of DC-DC Buck converter. A deep neural network and the dynamic models of the converter are seamlessly coupled. It overcomes the challenges related to training data, accuracy, and robustness which a typical data-driven approach has. This exemplary application envisions to provide a new perspective for tailoring existing machine learning tools for power electronics.
